This topic describes how to use the new Pro server feature for managing maven artifact versions for stream and task apps used with Spring Cloud® Data Flow for VMware Tanzu (Tanzu Application Service).

## <a id='new-application-version-alerts'></a> New Application Version Alerts and Continuous Delivery

The SCDF Pro dashboard can register applications by automatically retrieving the available versions of the registered maven applications from their associated maven repositories. With this automation in place, users can update existing Streams with these new versions of the registered applications.

Once an application's maven artifact is registered in SCDF's application registry, the server retrieves the latest available versions associated with the application by using the Maven Repository interface.

If the registry that is being used requires authentication, please see the [Maven Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-maven) from the documentation.

<div class="note">The current implementation checks for new versions available above (that is, more recent than) the current default version.

For instance, if you have an app registered with a version 2.0.0, all the versions above 2.0.0 are retrieved (if available) and listed in the SCDF Dashboard as available versions.</div>

You can update the registered maven artifacts from the `Applications` page. You can check for:

* updates on all the registered applications
* updates on the applications that are used by the Streams
* updates on the applications that are used by the Tasks

![Check for updates](images/Applications_Check_Updates.png)

<div class="note">Since this operation involves getting the versions of all the corresponding registered applications, it may take a few seconds to minutes depending on how many applications you have registered.</div>

Once the updates are available, the corresponding application is updated with the `i` icon to alert that there are new versions available. For instance, in the following screenshot, you can see that the application `filter` has new versions available.

Once the application versions are available, you can either:

* Register the available version(s) with SCDF by choosing them individually
* For stream applications, you can update the streams with the new versions of the applications.

The following example shows how to perform a Stream update:

Go to Streams list page:

![Streams List](images/Streams_List.png)

Click **UPDATE VERSION(S)**

After clicking **UPDATE VERSION(S)**, all the applications that are used by the Streams are updated with any of the available versions, and the following form is shown with the list of applications that have new versions available.

![Streams Update Apps List](images/Stream_Update_Apps_List.png)

Here you can choose the applications you would like to update and proceed by clicking **NEXT**.

![Streams Update Apps Select](images/Stream_Update_Apps_Select.png)

For each selected application, you can see the list of available versions. 

Note that the list of available versions shown here are the net-new versions for the same application. 

You can also choose a version to be the `default` version for the application in SCDF’s application registry going forward, this new version is used as the default version for stream deployments.

![Streams Update Apps Version Select](images/Stream_Update_AppVersionSelect.png)

You can select the version for all the other applications, as follows:

![Streams Update Another App Version Select](images/Stream_Update_AnotherApp_VersionSelect.png)

Once the new versions are selected for the applications, you can:

1. Register the newly selected version of each of the application that is part of the stream
2. Mark the selected version as the default version (if preferred)
3. Run the Stream update operation to update the applications’ version to the selected version

### <a id='single-stream-update'></a> Single Stream Update

If you prefer to update a single Stream by **only** choosing the specific versions of the applications associated with that Stream, then you can perform a single Stream update by just setting the application versions as below:

![Single Stream Selection](images/Single_Stream_Selection.png)

Once the Stream is selected, you can choose the application versions and update:

![Single Stream Selection Version](images/Single_Stream_Select_Version.png)

### <a id='individual-application-update'></a> Individual Application Update

You can also update the versions of the individual applications.

Go to the **Applications** page:

![Applications List](images/Applications_List.png)

Select the ellipsis icon available to the left of the individual application and click **Manage Version**, as follows:

![Applications List Manage Version](images/Applications_List_Manage_Version.png)

You see a form where you can select the latest available versions and mark them to be registered with SCDF. 

Note that you can register multiple versions this way.

![Application Manage Version](images/Application_Manage_Version.png)

![Application Manage Version Select](images/Application_Manage_Version_Select.png)

You also have an option to mark any of the currently selected versions as the `default` version for the application and proceed with the registration, as follows:
